# Metrics

This package is copied from [frequency-neural-networks](https://github.com/kzajac97/frequency-neural-networks) 
research repository, since it was useful for regression problems.

We find it easier to copy this piece of code than install additional library, since
it is easier to analyse and compare metrics with different research.
